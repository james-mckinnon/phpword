# PHPWord

This repository is an source code of [PHPWord](http://phpword.codeplex.com/), turned into [Composer](http://getcomposer.org/) package.
I cloned this from [kkula](https://bitbucket.org/kkula/phpword/) and made some changes to make it work with symfony2.

## Installation
All you have to do is to [get composer](http://getcomposer.org/download/) and add following lines to your `composer.json`:

        "require": {
           "ferdynator/phpword": "*"
        }
